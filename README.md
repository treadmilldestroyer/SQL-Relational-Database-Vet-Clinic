# Veterinarian Clinic SQL Database

In this project I created a SQL relational database using python. The vision of this project was to create a database that veterinarians can use to manage their patients. There are 4 functions that the user can do, query for existing patient records, add a new patient record, update an existing patient record, or delete an existing patient record.

## Instructions for Build and Use

[Software Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y1QHORfO08)

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Run program to create .db file and table
2. Perform any task, query, add, update, or delete that you want.
3. Use SQLite Viewer to view database in a more visual way. This shows the table and columns in a more excel-type format.

## Instructions for using the software:

How to query a patient:
1. From main menu press 1
2. Enter the type of query you want, search by date range or search all records

How to add a patient:
1. From main menu press 2
2. Input patient details

How to update a patient:
1. From main menu press 3
2. Enter patient ID (All patient ID with corresponding names are listed above)
3. Enter what detail type you would like to update
4. Enter the actual updated detail 

How to delete a patient:
1. From main menu press 4
2. Enter ID of patient you want to delete (All patient ID with corresponding names are listed above)

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* VS Code
* Python 3.14.2
* SQLite Viewer
* Libraries: sqlite3, random

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [W3 - SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
* [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/u/0/app)


## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I would like to make an app for this program so veterinarians don't have to use a terminal.
* [ ] Update the query function to be able to search for a patient record by any of the columns in the database.
