# Veterinarian Clinic SQL Database

In this project I created a SQL relational database using python. The vision of this project was to create a database that veterinarians can use to manage their patients. There are 4 functions that the user can do, query for existing patient records, add a new patient record, update an existing patient record, or delete an existing patient record.
